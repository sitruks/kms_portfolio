## **Porfolio: Take 3**

**MVP**
- The plan is to begin with a cleaner, modular one-pager with React.js
- There is a straight-forward process to convert html to jsx, which is essential to get the most out of React.
- This process will be utilized first to import the timeline feature, foremost. Other features were sub-par and will be net new.

**NEXT LEVEL SH!%**
- Gamify the user experience as laid out in my second porfolio update. 
- Though I will keep to the "Carmen San Diego" experience as planned, the format has since changed now that I have been introduced to new technologies.
    - socket.io
    - passport.js
    - MySQL
    - sequelize
